# Network Visualization
# A graph is the abstract, mathematical representation of a network (such as a road network in real life). Graphs are collections of vertices (nodes) and edges (links).
# A path is a sequence of unique vertices, such that any two vertices in the sequence are connected by an edge; the length of a path is the number of edges in that path.
# A graph is said to be connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
# In this Python project I import the NetworkX module, which contains many type of random graph generators, but also a few empirical datasets, and pick the Karate Club one.
# I visualize the graph with the nx.draw function.
